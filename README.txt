This was an overall fun challenge for me especially using jest to write unit tests which I haven't done before!
I used postman to make api requests and used MongoDb Atlas as a database to store my data. My connection string is in my 
server.js file.

I look forward to speaking with you soon and hope you have a great day.

Thank you,
Harjot Saroya
