This was an overall fun challenge for me especially using jest to write unit tests which I haven't done before!
I used postman to make api requests and used mongodb Atlas as a database to store my data. My connection string is in my 
server.js file for you to use.

I look forward to speaking with you soon and apologize for my delay, I hadn't seen the challenge till friday morning because I never
was notified from indeed.

Thank you,
Harjot Saroya
